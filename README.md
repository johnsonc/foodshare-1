# foodshare

Foodshare is a social platform with the aim of tackling food waste and hunger. The website allows users to post locations on a map coupled with information about the food they are giving away. The website will be tracking the information and displaying interesting statistics visually as new food share locations are added. The visualization will be a Choropleth to show food sharing hotspots. A filter will also be applied to narrow down where specific foods are being shared more.
